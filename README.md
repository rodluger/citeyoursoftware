# citeyoursoftware

Automatically generate ``BibTeX`` citations for all software explicitly
defined in your ``conda`` environment. This tool scrapes information from
``PyPI``, ``anaconda.com``, ``GitHub``, and other sources to find relevant
citation entries for all packages.

This is still a work in progress, so please stay tuned!
